Dashboard Overview – Airbnb Profitability Analysis
This dashboard was created in Tableau to help answer the key question:

“What type of Airbnb listing is most profitable for a new host, based on location, room type, and number of bedrooms?”
The dataset is from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset
The dashboard breaks this down using four key visualizations:

🛏️ Average Price per Bedroom
This bar chart shows how the average nightly price increases with the number of bedrooms
Listings with more bedrooms tend to command higher nightly prices, but they are less common. The table on the right shows how many listings exist for each bedroom count (e.g., most listings are 1-bedrooms).

📍 Price per Zip Code (Map View)
The map highlights average prices by zip code, showing which areas are more expensive.
Zip codes like 98119 and 98109 have the highest average prices, indicating potentially high-revenue areas.
Areas like 98133 and 98118 have lower prices.
Location significantly affects price—zip codes in central or tourist-heavy areas generally charge more per night.

📈 Revenue for Year (Line Chart)
This line graph shows the total revenue over time (weekly) during 2016.
Revenue steadily increases through the year, peaking around late November.
Indicates strong performance throughout the year, especially during holidays or tourist seasons.
There is consistent demand across the year with seasonal spikes, helpful for hosts planning availability.

🗂️ Price by Zip Code (Bar Chart)
This bar chart gives a clearer comparison of average price per zip code, allowing quick identification of high and low-performing areas.
Helps prioritize where to list a property for higher returns.

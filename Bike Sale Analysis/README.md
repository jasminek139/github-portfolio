Bike Sale Ananlysi:
This Excel dashboard visualizes bike purchase data segmented by gender, income, age, commute distance, marital status, education, and region. I cleaned the dataset and added a new age category called "Age Brackets" to better reflect customer demographics. 
The dashboard includes interactive filters that let users explore trends based on specific attributes like gender, purchase decision, and commute distance. Charts display insights such as average income per purchase and customer behavior across different regions, making it easy to understand who is buying bikes and why.

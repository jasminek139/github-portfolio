Bike Sale Analysis:

This Excel dashboard provides a detailed analysis of bike purchasing trends across various customer demographics. The dataset was first cleaned by removing duplicates and enhanced with the addition of a new age category, "Age Brackets", to better capture the diversity in age groups. 

The dashboard segments data by gender (female and male), purchase decision (yes or no), income levels, commute distance, marital status, education level, and geographic region (Europe, North America, and Pacific). Interactive filters allow users to drill down into specific groups and view customized insights. 

Visualizations include average income per bike purchase, customer commuting patterns, and age distribution, helping to uncover patterns in customer behavior and preferences. This tool is ideal for quickly understanding who is more likely to buy bikes and what factors may influence their decisions.
